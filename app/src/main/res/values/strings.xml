        reflects the resistance across the whole of the systemic circulation (from aorta to right atrium).\n
        As an individual ages the systolic pressure increases more than the diastolic pressure\n\n
        The Mean Arterial Pressure(MAP) is the mean pressure that moves blood to the tissues.\n
        Mean Arterial Pressure is closer to diastolic pressure than to systolic pressure because diastole lasts longer than systole.
        \n Mean Arterial Pressure is obtained by adding one third of the pulse pressure to the diastolic pressure.
        \n\n Pulse Pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure.\n\n
        Cardiac Output is defined as the quantity of blood ejected per minute by each ventricle.\n In a healthy heart this
        value is same for right and left ventricles.\n Cardiac Output can be said to be equal to Stroke Volume
        multiplied by heart rate.

        filtered from the renal(kidney) capillaries into the Bowmans capsule per unit time.\n
    GFR is equal to the clearance rate when any solute is freely filtered and is neither reabsorbed
        by the kidneys.\n GFR can be determined by injecting inulin or sinistrin(inulin-analog)
        into the plasma.\n GFR can be accurately measured using radioactive substances

    <string name="lean_mass_text">Lean Body Mass (LBM) is a part of body composition that is defined
        as the difference between total body weight and body fat weigh.\n This means that it counts
        the mass of all organs except body fat, including bones, muscles, blood,skin, and everything else.
        \n While the percentage of LBM is usually not computed, on average it ranges between 60-90% of
        total body weight.\n\n Generally men have a higher proportion of LBM than women do.\n Dosages
        of some anesthetic agents, particularly water-soluble drugs are routinely based on the LBM.
        Some medical exams also use the LBM values.\n Several formulas have been developed for calculating estimated LBM(eLBM)
        \n\n  Lean Body Mass Formula for Adults\n
        The Boer Formula:1\n
        For males:\n
        eLBM = 0.407W + 0.267H - 19.2\n
        For females:\n
        eLBM = 0.252W + 0.473H - 48.3\n
        The James Formula:2\n
        For males:\n
        eLBM = 1.1W - 128(	W/H)2\n
        For females:\n
        eLBM = 1.07W - 148(	W/H)2\n
        The Hume Formula:3\n
        For males:\n
        eLBM = 0.32810W + 0.33929H - 29.5336\n
        For females:\n
        eLBM = 0.29569W + 0.41813H - 43.2933\n\n
        This app was made using the Humes formula for individuals above 14 years and the Peters
        formula for individuals below 14 years. \n
        In the formulas above, W is the body weight in kilogram and H is the body height in centimeter.\n
        Lean Body Mass Formula for Children\n
        The Peters Formula:\n
        The author suggests that this formula is applicable for children aged 13-14 years old or younger.\n
        The formula is used to compute an eLBM based on an estimated extracellular volume (eECV) as follows:\n
        eECV = 0.0215·W0.6469·H0.7236\n
        eLBM = 3.8·eECV\n\n

    <string name="respiratory_system_text">LUNG VOLUMES\n  •	Tidal Volume(TV)\n It is the amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during one respiratory cycle.
        This depicts the functions of the respiratory centres, respiratory muscles and the mechanics of the lung and chest wall.\n\n
        The normal adult value is 10% of vital capacity (VC),
        approximately 300-500ml (6‐8 ml/kg); but can increase up to 50% of VC on exercise\n\n •	Inspiratory Reserve Volume(IRV)\n
        It is the amount of air that can be forcibly inhaled after a normal tidal volume.IRV is usually kept in reserve,
        but is used during deep breathing. The normal adult value is 1900-3300ml.\n\n
        •	Expiratory Reserve Volume(ERV)\n
        It is the volume of air that can be exhaled forcibly after exhalation of normal tidal volume.
        The normal adult value is 700-1200ml. ERV is reduced with obesity, ascites or after upper abdominal surgery\n\n
        •	Residual Volume(RV)\n It is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximal exhalation. Normal adult value is averaged at 1200ml(20‐25 ml/kg).
        It is indirectly measured from summation of FRC and ERV and cannot be measured by spirometry.\n\n
        In obstructive lung diseases with features of incomplete emptying of the lungs and air trapping, RV may be significantly high.
        The RV can also be expressed as a percentage of total lung capacity and values in excess of 140% significantly increase the risks of barotrauma, pneumothorax,
        infection and reduced venous return due to high intra thoracic pressures as noticed in patients
        with high RV who require surgery and mechanical ventilation thus needs high peri-operative inflation pressures.\n\n Lung volumes also known as respiratory volumes,
        refers to the volume of gas in the lungs at a given time during the respiratory cycle.
        Lung capacities are derived from a summation of different lung volumes.
        The average total lung capacity of an adult human male is about 6 litres of air.
        Lung volumes measurement is an integral part of pulmonary function test. These volumes vary,
        depending on the depth of respiration, ethnicity, gender, age, body composition and in certain respiratory diseases.
        A number of the lung volumes can be measured by Spirometry- Tidal volume, Inspiratory reserve volume, and Expiratory reserve volume.
        However, measurement of Residual volume, Functional residual capacity, and Total lung capacity is through body plethysmography,
        nitrogen washout and helium dilution technique.\n\n LUNG CAPACITIES\n •	Inspiratory capacity(IC)\n
        It is the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled following a resting state.
        It is calculated from the sum of inspiratory reserve volume and tidal volume. IC = IRV+TV\n\n
        •	Total Lung Capacity(TLC)\n It is the maximum volume of air the lungs can accommodate or sum of all volume compartments or volume of air in lungs after maximum inspiration.
        The normal value is about 6,000mL(4‐6 L). TLC is calculated by summation of the four primary lung volumes (TV, IRV, ERV, RV).\n
        TLC may be increased in patients with obstructive defects such as emphysema and decreased in patients with restrictive abnormalities including chest wall abnormalities and kyphoscoliosis
        \n\n •	Vital Capacity(VC)\n It is the total amount of air exhaled after maximal inhalation.
        The value is about 4800mL and it varies according to age and body size.
        It is calculated by summing tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory reserve volume. VC = TV+IRV+ERV.\n
        VC indicates ability to breathe deeply and cough, reflecting inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength.VC should be 3 times greater than TV for effective cough.
        VC is sometimes reduced in obstructive disorders and always in restrictive disorders\n\n
        •	Function Residual Capacity(FRC)\n It is the amount of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation.
        It is calculated by adding together residual and expiratory reserve volumes. The normal value is about 1800 – 2200 mL. FRC = RV+ERV.
        \n\n It is the amount of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation.
        It is calculated by adding together residual and expiratory reserve volumes. The normal value is about 1800 – 2200 mL. FRC = RV+ERV.
